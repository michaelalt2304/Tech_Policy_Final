### HOW TO START ###
1. Download Python >= 3.8, <= 3.12 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Add Python to PATH, with this tutorial, if necessary: https://realpython.com/add-python-to-path/. With Windows, this is often an option upon installation, meaning you can skip this step.
3. Type python run_me.py into any terminal and you should be done! The Streamlit app should pop up in your browser.
4. Modify main.py with additional st functions - you'll see the first one there.
